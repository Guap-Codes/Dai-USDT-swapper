# Dai-USDT-swapper
This JavaScript code snippet uses the Uniswap SDK and ethers.js library to swap Dai for USDT tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It starts by initializing the provider and signer, defining the token addresses and amounts, and creating token objects. Then it fetches the token pairs and calculates the current price before creating a trade object. The trade is approved and then executed on the Uniswap decentralized exchange contract by calling the swapExactTokensForTokens function with the specified parameters, including the deadline for the transaction to be executed by. This code demonstrates how to perform a simple token swap using the Uniswap decentralized exchange and Ethereum blockchain.
